Digital forms are a popular method for collecting data.
The support for real-time validations that filter invalid provided data makes them particularly desirable.
However, writing validation code is often regarded as a repetitious and tedious task.

The goal of this project is to develop a validation synthesizer: upon receiving a set of valid and invalid example values for a formâ€™s input fields, the synthesizer automatically generates a validation, i.e., a Boolean expression that evaluates to \true{} for all valid examples and \false{} for all invalid ones. 
To increase confidence in the synthesised validation, we propose a user interaction model in which a new example input field value is presented to the user, who classifies it as valid or invalid to resolve any ambiguities in the original specification.
This document overviews several program synthesis techniques and delineates the methodology that will be used to implement the validation synthesizer.
