\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatically separate invalid and conditional invalid examples, so users don't need to differentiate them;
    
    \item Better interaction model: fewer, more comprehensive questions. A binary search for the capture conditions would be really cool;
    
    \item A better sketching model! Sketching is used successfully in a myriad of synthesizers, why can't I? (the multi-tree is similar, but not the same). Maybe even use NLP based sketches, like REGEL.
    
    \item Other character groups, such as [,./] for separators. Also, include UTF-8 characters in character classes.
\end{itemize}
